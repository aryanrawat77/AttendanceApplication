# Attendance Management Application

## Overview
This Attendance Management Application is designed to streamline attendance tracking and management processes. Built using Java and Spring Boot, the application leverages RESTful APIs to provide a robust backend system for managing user data, including location, check-in and check-out times, and the ability to export attendance records in CSV format.

## Features
- **User Management:** Create, update, and manage user profiles.
- **Location-Based Tracking:** Manage users based on their city or ID, enabling easy access to location-specific data.
- **Check-In/Check-Out Tracking:** Record and track user check-in and check-out timestamps.
- **CSV Export:** Export user attendance data to a CSV file for reporting and analysis.

## Project Structure
- **User Repository:** Manages all database interactions related to user data.
- **User Controller:** Contains RESTful API endpoints for managing user-related operations.
- **User Model:** Defines the data structure for user information, including location, check-in/check-out times.
